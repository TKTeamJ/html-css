  <h2>Evolution and Milestones of Alidata</h2>

  <p>
    "Throughout its evolution, Alidata has been able to create new solutions, conquer new markets, and grow sustainably. It is well positioned to ensure the continuity of its presence in the market with quality and precision, the scalability of its products with releases and version updates, always with the possibility of evolving towards more advanced solutions, in order to keep up with the demands of the market and its clients."
  </p>

  <p>
    "Alidata's evolution has had many important milestones, as a result of its constant desire to grow and reach further."
  </p>

  <h3>Early Years and Expansion in the 1990s</h3>

  <p>
    "In its early years, aligned with the state of the art at the time, it created accounting and management software (stock control, current accounts, invoicing, and others). At the beginning of the 1990s, it felt the need to do more and keep up with what was starting to emerge internationally: personnel management software, fixed assets, financial management, equipment maintenance, production process control, among others. It was in this decade that the term “ERP” (Enterprise Resource Planning) gained momentum, an opportunity that Alidata seized by creating an integrated management tool."
  </p>

  <h3>Certification and Internationalsation</h3>

  <p>
    "As a result of continuous improvement efforts, in 2003 it obtained the Quality Certificate according to the ISO 9001:2000 standard. This was an important milestone, as it decisively contributed to increasing Alidata's productivity and innovation, making the company more organised and, consequently, more competitive."
  </p>

  <p>
    "It was also at this time that we took the first steps towards internationalisation. Initially, this involved supporting our clients who were exploring new markets."
  </p>

  <h3>Nacional Expansion and Strategic Alliances</h3>

  <p>
    "2008 was the year we invested in expanding our national presence, which was realised with the opening of a branch in Lisbon."
  </p>

  <p>
    "In 2011, we established a strategic alliance with Sendys, a software house with a long-standing history similar to Alidata's, whose offerings also complemented those of Alidata."
  </p>

  <h3>Commitment and Resilience</h3>

  <p>
    "We are fully aware that Alidata's evolution depended on everyone's commitment to the company's success, continuous effort, but above all, the will to do things differently, constantly seeking new paths and opportunities."
  </p>

  <p>
    "It’s already been 40 years! Such longevity with success is only achieved through hard work and resilience."
