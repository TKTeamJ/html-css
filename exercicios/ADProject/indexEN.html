  <h2>Final Project - Alidata</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>What are we going to explore in this project?</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    Alidata is a great portuguese software company, that has been active for 40 years. The group which owns the company, has others branches on the software industry, varying in countries and continents. For example, Angola, Mozambique, Brazil and Macau/China.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    In this first part of the project, Alidata's journey will be explored, highlighting its most significant moments, main areas of activity, and the impact it had on the development of the software sector in Portugal.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The second part of the website is dedicated to the internship calendar, where daily summaries of the activities carried out have been archived. This digital archive also exists in physical form; however, it is more organised, structured, and easier to read.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    To conclude this small project, a report on the internship carried out was prepared, which includes the learning, the skills acquired, as well as an analysis of what could have been improved.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This project represents an important stage in academic training as a student, allowing the application of theoretical knowledge in a real context. It is also possible to observe how a company operates in the workplace.
